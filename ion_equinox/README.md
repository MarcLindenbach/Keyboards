Ion Equinox Acrylic Case
========================

The case file can be opened with FreeCAD.

To build you'll need:
- 1x bottom layer
- 1x resting layer
- 1x gasket layer
- 3x mid layers
- 1x top layer

If you're building with the plate layer, you can swap it for one of the mid layers. Please note that I have not tested the plate layer.

You'll need M2 screws and standoffs to assemble the case.

You'll also need some sort of adhesive, thin foam to put on the bottom of the PCB legs to get them to fit snugly in the gasket cutouts.
